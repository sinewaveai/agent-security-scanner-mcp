# =============================================================================
# Sample Workflow: Security Scan on Pull Requests
# =============================================================================
#
# Uses the agent-security-scanner-mcp composite action to automatically
# scan pull requests for security vulnerabilities, package hallucinations,
# and prompt injection risks.
#
# This workflow:
#   1. Checks out the code with full git history (needed for diff scanning)
#   2. Runs the security scan composite action
#   3. Fails the PR check if issues exceed the severity threshold
#
# Customize the inputs below to match your project's requirements.
